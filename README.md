# About
<p align="justify">
The main purpose of this application is to streamline access to the account of friends, employees or even yours, easily providing the path to the main Github projects for that user. You can also see what your latest searches were through your search history. This application was created especially for iOS.
</p>

# How it works
<p>
1. On the search page you will find a field to enter the username
(Attention: only the username) and a button to do the search.

/>
</p>
<p>
2. As soon as you click the button, a record of your search is
visible in your search history and you can repeat it.

/>
</p>
<p>
3. Your search will return the main information and repositories
about that user, thus facilitating, the access to the projects of
that account.
